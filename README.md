Charity Donation Matching Service

## Overview

Donating to charity is a Good Thingâ„¢. Even better than donating to charity alone is donating to charity whilst incentivising others to do it too...

Enter [donation matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_funds). Currently if you want to set up a donation matching fund, the process is to either contact a charitable organisation directly or set up a fund yourself with all the associated management and trust issues. The reality of which is that donation matching is only feasible for very large sums of money (100k+).

The goal of this project is to create a service for creating and contributing to matching funds for everyone.
